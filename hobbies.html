			  <h3>Fishing</h3>
			  <p>Being from Miami fishing just comes naturally. My friend Danny has a house in the Keys that we usually fish out of. Nothing is better than waking up at 5 in the morning to go buy bait and set out on the water for a good day of fishing. I find fishing to be relaxing and very fulfilling. Catching your own dinner is its own reward.</p>

			  <h3>Shooting</h3>
			  <p>From a young age I always loved firearms. Coming from a pretty reserved family I had to pursue my love of firearms on my own. I love going out to the range and putting a few rounds through my guns. Recently I had the chance to go shoot clays with shotguns at a range in Gainesville. The experience was exhillirating and I feel it will be one of my new favorite hobbies.</p>

			  <h3>Video Games </h3>
			  <p>A large part of the reason why I'm a computer science student is due to my love for video games. Video games are some of the most complex pieces of software out there and they greatly interest me. I find it amazing how a piece of software can bring people together and create memories like video games have for me. Working for a gaming company is one of my professional dreams.</p>

            <div class="content_container">
			  <h3>Electronic Music</h3>
			  <p> I was introduced to electronic music in high school and have only grown more interested in it as the years have passed. Since I was first introduced I have built a large library of songs numbering in the 10,000's. I enjoy going out to clubs and attending festival events where some of the worlds greatest DJs convene to play the music they love. My love for the music has actually lead me to start learning how to DJ.</p>
