          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
			<p> I have had 3 major work experiences to date. I developed an app for Shands Hospital at UF, I was an assisstant director for the UF Gator Growl website, and I had an internship with Florida Power & Light over the Summer of 2015   </p>

      <p>Shands Hospital:
        The purpose of this job was to develop an app on antibiotic resistance. The project was coined "Operation Superbugs!" and was primarily targeted towards children and their parents. I developed the application with a 3rd party software from a company called Biznessapps. The Biznessapps web app allowed me to create an application that could be pushed to multiple platforms. The app was released recently on Google Play, the Apple Store, and as a standalone mobile site. To download the app please visit your app store of choice and search "Operation Superbugs! Combatting Antibiotic Resistance"</p>

        <p>University of Flordia Gator Growl Website:
        Gator Growl is the University of Florida's equivalent of homecoming week. Hundreds of work hours go into advertising and preparation for the event. The Gator Growl website is the main point of contact between students and the event coordinators and as such it must be periodically updated and maintaned. As an assistant director I helped the main developer of the Gator Growl site bring it up to date. I acquired some HTML experience here since this was one of the first times I worked with websites. Here is the site if you'd like to give it a visit <a href="http://www.gatorgrowl.org"> here.</a>
        </p>

        <p>Florida Power & Light Internship:
        Over the Summer of 2015 I was lucky enough to be accepted into the NextEra Energy Internship Program. NextEra Energy is a large company that owns several subsidiaries nationwide. One of those subsidiaries is Florida Power & Light (FPL) which is the largest utility in Florida. Over the summer at FPL I worked as a geospatial analyst. I became familiar with certain aspects of SQL, HTML, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology, professional communication, and organizational skills. Also over the course of the internship I had the opportunity to earn a Six Sigma Yellow Belt Certification. The Yellow Belt provided me with special statistical and analytical tools that I can use to improve or even develop processes within a business.
