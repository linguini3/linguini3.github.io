		  <h1>Welcome To My Website</h1> 
         <p> My name is Ricky Rodriguez. I am from Miami and come from Cuban heritage. Both of my parents were born in Cuba and had left to the United States while they were still very young. I enjoy the Hispanic culture that comes with being Cuban. Cubans are very extroverted and are not afraid to speak their minds. They are also very family oriented. Cuban households are tightly knit to the point where no one is allowed to close the doors to their rooms. Cuban food is my favorite and I know all the best spots to have a bite in Miami. </p>

  <p>Growing up in Miami I was actually not as extroverted as the usual Cuban would be. I preferred to keep to myself and the highlights of my days were coming home from school to play video games until late at night. This phase of my life lasted until about senior year of high school. After senior year I had a dramatic change in my lifestyle. I started to go out more often. I'd start being the center of attention in a room and made several new friends because of it. My social life actually became a healthy normal part of my daily routine. This is not to say that I lost my love for video games. As a matter of fact I am still very interested in games.</p>

  <p>I feel that my early interest in video games lead me to be where I am today studying Computer Science at the University of Florida. Along with the love for the games I played I started to become interested in the machines that ran those games. Hence I became a lover of anything tech, primarily computers and cell phones. By the time I graduated high school I couldnâ€™t see myself studying anything other than computer science. I've recently begun researching how to build computers and will hopefully start my first build soon.</p>

  <p>Outside of my interests in tech I have a few other hobbies. Working out was never really a major thing for me until I started becoming more social. I realized that exercise was amazing both for my body and my mind since it was a great stress reliever. Currently I am working out at the UF gym but have done several other activities such as crossfit and mixed martial arts. The other major hobby of mine is the military. I love studying military history and keeping up to date with the status of things overseas. Along with this passion for the military I started to become interested in firearms and knives. Nowadays I have a large pocket knife collection and will hopefully start a gun collection someday.</p>

  <p>In sum I'd like to think of myself as a pretty approachable person. I feel my wide range of hobbies lends me to be interested in new things easily. I always enjoy meeting new people and trying new things.</p>
